# Koditoriet
...is an IT consultancy based in Gothenburg, Sweden.

We specialize in functional programming, type-based data modeling, compilers, and development tools.
We also do open source software, usually within those same areas.

Our VP of sales is a tiny dog, and any contract with us comes with an option for headpats.
