# Koditoriet
...is an IT consultancy based in Gothenburg, Sweden.

We specialize in functional programming, type-based data modeling, compilers, and development tools.
We also do open source software, usually within those same areas.

Some open source projects we have worked on:

- The [VossII](https://github.com/TeamVoss/VossII) IC verification suite
- The [4koma](https://github.com/valderman/4koma) TOML processing library for Kotlin
- The [Haste](https://haste-lang.org) Haskell-to-JavaScript compiler
- The [Selda](https://selda.link) relational database DSL
- The [qui.su](https://github.com/valderman/qui.su) web-based flipped classroom tool
- The [Mesmerise](https://github.com/mesmerise-project/mesmerise) interactive storytelling tool

Our VP of sales is a tiny dog, and any contract with us comes with an option for headpats.
